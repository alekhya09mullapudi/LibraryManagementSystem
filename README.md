# LibraryManagementSystem
Libraries currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of information. The current system requires numerous paper forms with data storage.  The manual handling of the record is time-consuming and highly prone to errors. The purpose of this project is to automate the activities such as searching for a book or making record of the borrowed books, etc.
